# NLP Analysis of Social Media Comments and Tweets

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a comprehensive dataset of social media content from Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The analysis uses various NLP methods to extract insights and patterns from social media interactions.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the [Social Media Sentiments Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashishparmar02/social-media-sentiments-analysis-dataset) from Kaggle, which includes comments and tweets from multiple social media platforms:
- Facebook comments
- Instagram comments
- Twitter tweets

## Implemented NLP Techniques

### 1. Word Cloud Analysis
- Visual representation of word frequency in the dataset
- Identification of most common terms and themes across platforms
- Comparative analysis between different social media sources

### 2. Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob
- Classification of content sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Emotional tone analysis
- Platform-specific sentiment patterns

### 3. Text Classification with FastText
- Automated categorization of social media content

## Project Objectives

1. **Content Analysis**: Deep dive into social media content patterns
2. **Cross-Platform Comparison**: Analysis of differences between platforms
3. **Sentiment Understanding**: Comprehensive sentiment analysis across social networks
4. **Automated Classification**: Development of reliable text classification models

## Technologies Used

- Python for data processing and analysis
- NLTK and SpaCy for NLP tasks
- FastText for text classification
- WordCloud for visualization
- TextBlob for s√¨sentiment analysis
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization

## Future Improvements

- Implementation of more advanced NLP techniques
- Enhanced visualization methods
- Real-time analysis capabilities
- Integration with additional social media platforms
